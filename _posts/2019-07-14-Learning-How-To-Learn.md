# Learning How to Learn
### Types of Learning
* Focused Learning
* Diffused Leaning

**_Focused_** learning is where we know the task in hand like adding 2 numbers. Our brain needn't think from a larger perspective. It activates the brain that knows how to process the task at hand. This doesn't need the imagination or a broader perspective. But many tasks and unsolved task. Imagine Einstein sitting at his table in a small patent office he worked ans speculating the universe is constantly expanding. This requires lot of effort and enery which brings us to the second type of learning.

**_Diffused_** learning is where we may have to come up with strategies. This is Innovation as we like to call it. We need to strategy around how we are approaching the task in hand. Even the adding operation in the last example needs. In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can look at things broadly from a very different, big picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can't focusin as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving. Or understand the finest aspects of a concept.

It seems you can't be in both thinking modes at the same time. It's kind of like a coin. We can see either one side, or the other side of the coin. But not both sides at the same time.

When we are learning something new, We should be able to go back and forth between the two types of thinking. That's what helps you learn effectively. We need to learn everyday to flex our brain a bit and keep it ready. A good analogy would be having going to the gym everyday to build muscles.

### What is learning ?

We think abliity to do math and chess are amazing which require years of training. We take for granted the abilities like seeing and running, balancing the center of gravity of our body. A very cheap computer can beat us in Math but even the fastest are not better than us at processing vision.

On a side note, Sleep is where the brain forms its most reliable connections. It is very important for it functioning at its highest possible configuration.

### Procrastination

It is what hold millions of people back. When we start a task that is painful to us it triggers the areas in the brain related to generating pain. This unease makes us shy away from the task.

**Pomodoro** Technique is setting a timer of 25 minutes and removing all interruptions between sessions. Almost anyone can focus for 25 minutes. Then make the brain happy for the remaining 5 minutes. This can be web surfing, calling your parents. Bascically reward your brain after a brutal mental workout. It is the resting moment for the brain. 

When we look an item we see it's physical presence or hear things. Our brain can make sense of it. Math ans science are more abstract and exist only in our head and intangible. So this means we need more diffused learning to deal with them. Use Pomodoro to let diffused learning mode to kick and process ideas in the background in the free time after a session.

### Introduction to Memory

There are two types of Memory.
* Working Memory 
* Long-term memory

Working memory has to do with what we're immediately working on. It works out of the pre-frontal cortex. It holds about 4-7 chunks of information. We automatically chunk information so we can make up for the less space. Eg. We remember the phone number as 988-000-1234 in three chunks rather than 10 individual digits. We may clos our eyes to prevent other items making their way into our working memery. It needs a bit of repetition to fit something here.

Short term memory is like an inefficient mental blackboard. The other form of memory, the long-term memory is like a data warehouse. It has the capacity to have billions of items. So much so that some of it is buried deep inside. We need to practice a bit to get it out.

Long term memory is important as it is the one that stores the important imformation needed over the long term. Nay new fundamental concepts we learn are commited to the long term memory. This means we need to repeat stuff to get it registered there. To hel we use *spaced repetition*.

**Spaced Repetition** is learning the same thing 1 time at a day for 20 days instead of 20 times a single evening. It is better to learn multiple things at once rather than focus on one and then move on to others if we can be disciplined enough.

### Importance of Sleep

Brain gets rid of lot of toxins by increasing the flow of the cerebro-spinal fluid at least in [mice](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep). The brain shrank in the mice to allow for better flow. Sleep also rehearses the things we want to remember better and strengthens the neural pattern. It's as if shutting the pre-frontal cortex responsible for the conscisous us and allow the rest of the brain to coordinate better. Of course you need to seed it first by reading some material with intense focus. It helps if it is in the evening or before we nap. Dreaming also helps and enahances learning and consolidating chunks according to some sources though i take this statement with a grain of salt.

### What is a Chunk?
When we learn something new, It is akin to a jumbled jig-saw puzzle. Chunking helps in putting few of it together, though we don't know how these fit together.
When we are learning something woth focus, our pre-frontal cortex juggles things in and out of the brain to the four chunks inside it, trying to make sense and chunks things together to assimilate more information into the 4 chunks. When we are _stressed_ we lose our ability to this well. When we are either angry, afraid, nervous or stressed we lose this functionality.

A good analogy would be why we learn a language quickly if we are with people who speak it. We learn with focus words from a book and then have diffused learning when we speak with others. It is much faster than learning only from books wihtout conversing in it. 

A chunk is a network of neurons which fier together and know to do a task well. Focused practice and repetition can help build strong memory traces. Chunks are not all that is needed to become truly a master, but they help the brain with resources as we can ignore the underlying details relying on a chunk. Think of it like dressing, a single thought involving multple operations like swirls of clothes, tucking your limbs.

### How to from a Chunk?

Every Learning is a tad different. Learning to dance is different compared to learning math. Chunking physical motions is not he same as History or Art. 
The _first_ step of chunking is to provide **undivided attention** to the task at hand. If we are running media in the background, looking up the social feed or mail mean that our brain is having difficulty chunking. WE have limited working memory and nothing should interfere with it's process.
The _second_ step is to gain **understanding**. Be it anything, we are trying to learn, we can always grasp the gist of it, if we allow the two modes of thinking work together taking turns. Understanding is like that _super glue_ an encompassing memory trace which hold vaious other chunks together. You'd realize by now, this is how we create larger chunks. We shouldn't mistake _aha's_ in the class with true undestanding. We often see that we understand something when we read it only to not know it in the future. Many time doing it ourselves, closing the book and solving the math problem again is the key to mastery. Looking at some play chess, we understand theor moves but true mastery is in playing it ourselves and win.
The _third_ step is **gaining context**, so we see not just how but also when and where we can use this chunk. Context means thinking broadly, comapre it with previously assimilated information, repeating and practicing with unrelated and unrelated problems. This helps us see where this chunk fits into the bigger picture.  Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique.

Summing it up, chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context. Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you're
learning.

### Illusions of competence

One of the most common mistakes is to reread the material from a book or from notes taken earlier. This approach is far less productive than _**recall**_. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read. Also better would be to do it at the end of spaced repetition at the end of today's session and the start of next day's session. Another grea way is to draw concept maps to help understant and gain context of the chunk. Merely glancing at a solution and thinking we know it ourselves is an _Illusion of competence_.
Recall is a very powerful tool. Another tip is to change the area of study while recall. We often take in subliminal cues from the physical surroundings.

### What Motivates us?

It is hard to learn when you're not into it. But if it's something you're really interested in, learning is easy. Why is that? Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how neurons respond to other neurons. They are _Acetylcholine, Dopamine and Serotonin._ 

Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning, when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity. Leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.

Dopamine neurons are part of a large brain system that controls reward learning and in particular in the basal ganglia, which is located in the green region above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex at the top of the brain. Dopamine is released from these neurons, when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning. And this is something that also affects decision-making. When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section you are tapping into your dopamine system. 

Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life. Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of Serotonin activity. The level of Serotonin is also closely linked to risk taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society. 


The value of a **library of chunks** is combining chunks to form innovations. Chess Masters can access thousands of patterns at once. Chunks can also help in newer topics. It is astounding to know that there are multiple chunks related in fields we want to master. This is called *transfer*. The ribbon of chunks keep getting stronger, the neurons denser and we a master of the trade. If we don't practice these chunks keep getting fainter with time.

### Overlearning, Einstellung, Interleaving
When we practice over and over again in the same study session it is  _overlearning_. It can have it's place. It gives automaticity to the process. But it is not recommended in general. Even better would be to learn it again the next day. Otherwise it can lead to a wastage of precious learning time. 
We shouldn't learn the same thing again and again as we find it easy and rewarding that we know this. We need _deliberate practice_ every day focusing on the most difficult parts we want to achieve. Try to master the difficult stuff. It is like adding weights everyday instead of doing the same weights for an year.
The German word _Einstellung_ means mindset. We need to change it at times and try thinking from a different perspective to deepen our understanding. This will also lead to unlearning the erroneous older ideas.
We shouldn't jump into the pool without learning how to swim. While we may somehow learn something, It is not optimal. I'm not a great typist. I'm not a hunt and peck typist either. But i'm not a great typist. That is because i just started coding without learning the ways of touch typing. My current method doesn't give me much scope to improve. Learn before you do hands'on as we can then have certain context of what is going to happen.
**Interleaving** is very important. We can either cycle multiple unrelated subjects (say a pomodoro session for a subject). This means we need more retrieval of information when we arrive at the subject again leading to better understanding of the subject. It is more beneficial if the topics are related. From a coding perspective, I start building a project looking up things i need on google, while also learning the language or concepts from a book/tutorial. Mind that interleaving should not lead to switching subjects as soon as we encounter difficult materail. Having fixed time for each session is helpful in mitigating this issue. Instead, we should persist in one subject until they have a sense of accomplishment before moving on to another subject.

### Introduction to Procrastination and Memory
Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is difficult to come by. It is not appropriate to spend willpower in fending off procrastination. Procrastination is akin to addiction, offering temporary relief excitement and taking us away from the boring reality. We also sometimes go ahead and tell ourselves irrational reasons like, I was always bad at maths.
When we do everyday tasks, our brain goes into _zombie_ mode where it does tasks without bothering with the minor details though they are taken care of but just not in the working memory. This is **Habit**.

Habit has a _cue_, that triggers it. Passing by a food joint, seeing a vehicle rushing towards us all are cues. _Routine_ is going in to the shop and eating junk and dodging the vehicle._Reward_ is the immediate feeling of relief and pleasure. There is another one _belief_, which is a notion we have that we cannot change our habits.

**Process** vs **Product** is important to know here. Process means that i will do a pomodoro session on learning chess. Product means i want to be a ChessMaster. It is important to focus on process as it is easier and enforces a habit rather than product.

Cues are mostly dependant on 
* Time
* Location
* Feelings
* Reaction to other people's words

We need to change our response to these cues. Do not eat that favorite snack as you by it on the way back home. Altering the habit drastically requires lot of willpower and not recommended. We may feel like we have a lot of willpower. Even if that is case it is still beneficial to use it sparingly. Rewire the brain to slowly alter the behaviour. As we get better, the activity starts getting better.

_Time after time, those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill_.

Set a quitting time and write your task the night before to be clear and have more odds of finishing the tasks. Start with most impleasant task right off the morning.

A final checklist
* Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work.
* Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
* Write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success.
* Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.
* Always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards.
* Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes.
* Deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task.
* Watch for procrastination cues. Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library.
* Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry.
* Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one’s perfect after all.
* Eat your frogs first every day. Happy experimenting.

**Pysical Execise** might jest be the best thing we can do to oir bodies to increase the conginitive abilities. It helps all the body in general but usually people do not know it significantly improves brain activity too.

**_If you change your thoughts, you can really, truly change your life._**
